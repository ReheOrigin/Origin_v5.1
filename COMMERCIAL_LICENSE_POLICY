# Commercial Licensing Policy for Origin v5.1

## 1. Free Use (AGPLv3)
All source code is licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3).  
Academic, non-profit, and individual use is completely free and encouraged.

## 2. Commercial Use
Any for-profit entity using Origin v5.1 in R&D, drug discovery, service offerings, or any revenue-generating 
activity must obtain a commercial agreement.  
Two simple options exist:

### A. Custom Run Service (most companies start here)
You send me your private data → I run Origin v5.1 on my secured instance → you receive the full results 
(vectors + tags + report).  
No code leaves my machine, no AGPL obligations triggered.  
Pricing: per-run or subscription.

### B. Enterprise License
You want to install and run the software internally and/or keep modifications private.  
A paid commercial license removes the AGPL source-disclosure requirement and includes:
- Right to modify and keep changes proprietary
- Priority support and consulting
- Stable, supported releases
- Standard warranties and indemnification

Contact: rrehe.Origin@gmail.com for pricing and terms.

The proprietary Global Living Atlas (Tier 1) and future modules (OriginX, OriginB) are never included in any license and remain exclusive to the author and strategic partners.
