Commercial Licensing Policy for Origin v5.1

Overview
Origin v5.1 operates under a Dual Licensing model. This policy details the requirements and benefits for any entity engaging in commercial use of the Software.
Academic / Non-Commercial Use
For clarity, research use by non-profit entities is governed by the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3). 
This requires all modifications to the source code to be made public, ensuring that academic improvements benefit the community (and are returned to the core knowledge base).

Commercial Use Requirements:
Commercial Use is defined as any utilization of Origin v5.1—including running the code, modifying the source, or using its output—by a for-profit entity for purposes 
related to internal drug discovery, R&D, service offering, or revenue generation.
Entities engaged in Commercial Use must obtain a written Commercial License from the author, Robert-James Rehe.

Benefits of a Commercial License:
A paid Commercial License specifically exempts the licensee from the AGPLv3 requirement to share source code, granting the following critical rights and advantages:
Retention of Proprietary IP: The licensee gains the right to use, modify, and integrate Origin v5.1 into proprietary, private workflows without 
the obligation to publicly disclose their modified source code or customizations. This is the primary value proposition, allowing the company to safeguard its R&D secrets.

Dedicated Support & Consultation: Access to priority technical support, troubleshooting, and consultation services for custom data integration, pipeline optimization, 
and advanced feature requests.
Warranties and Indemnification: Access to standard business warranties and legal assurances regarding intellectual property and fitness for commercial purpose 
(which large enterprises require for legal and procurement sign-off).

Version Stability: Guaranteed access to specific, stable, and commercially supported releases of the Software.

How to Proceed

Companies have two primary options for engaging with Origin v5.1:

A. Custom Run Service

The fastest path. The author runs the Software on the client's private data matrix (e.g., 50–100 samples) and delivers the results and analysis. 
This is typically priced per run.
None (Service Agreement)

B. Enterprise License

The client purchases a non-AGPL license to install and run the Software internally, modify the source code, and keep all improvements secret.
