# Commercial Licensing Policy – Origin v5.1 and Global Living Atlas  
(Last revised: 28 November 2025 – this document will never be substantively altered again)

## 1. Free / Open-Source Tier (AGPLv3)
- Source code: GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
- Academic, non-profit, individual use: completely free forever
- All generated vectors automatically flow to public Tier 2 (read/write for all)

## 2. Academic Exclusive Partnership – Odyssey Program
**(100 % dormant as of 28 November 2025 – zero Exclusive seats exist today)**

No institution currently enjoys any privilege beyond normal paid Tier 1 access.

The full Odyssey Program below activates irrevocably the instant Robert-James Rehe publicly declares  
“Odyssey Program is now active” (signed GitHub commit, email from rrehe.Origin@gmail.com, or on-chain transaction).

Until that exact declaration, the program remains completely dormant.

### One-time pre-activation exception (Founder’s sole prerogative)
Before official activation, exactly five (5) institutions worldwide may receive a temporary 6-month full-Exclusive preview at the founder’s absolute discretion.

These five preview seats:
- Start immediately upon private agreement
- Expire automatically after 6 months or upon official activation (whichever is sooner)
- Do not count against future Aotearoa or Global Constellation seats
- Are non-transferable and non-renewable

This is the only pre-activation exception that will ever exist.

Expression of interest (one page maximum) → odyssey-preview@origin.institute  
(No other address, no templates, no follow-ups, no lobbying.)

### Privileges for all Odyssey seats (upon activation)
- Permanent private Tier 1 vector storage
- Full AGPLv3 source-disclosure exemption
- Unlimited cost-price runs on every Origin engine forever
- Voting seat on the closed Origin X training-data council
- Day-one access to every new model, feature, and hardware integration

### 2A. Aotearoa Tier – New Zealand National Seats (upon activation)
- Fixed at exactly 3 seats reserved exclusively for NZ institutions
- Every 2 years after activation (synchronised with Global tier): lowest-performing NZ seat automatically replaced by the next-best NZ institution
- These 3 seats can never be awarded to non-NZ entities

### 2B. Global Constellation Tier (upon activation)
- Fixed at exactly 20 seats open to any institution worldwide
- Every 2 years on 1 January after activation: bottom 3 seats automatically demoted
- Pure merit – no protection whatsoever

### 2C. Odyssey Performance Metric (activates only with the program)
Novel pathways successfully submitted to Tier 3  
× Origin X citations crediting the institution’s Tier 1 data  
× Real-world translational impact score  
(Exact weights and data sources will be published and permanently locked at activation)

Demoted institutions keep permanent read access to their historical Tier 1 vectors; new runs write only to Tier 2.

No applications, no lobbying, no discretionary overrides after activation.  
Leaderboard and seat changes executed by audited smart-contract code.

Total active Exclusive institutions once activated: maximum 23.

This policy is final and its substantive rules will never be altered.  
Operational details (emails, on-chain addresses, minor clarifications) may be updated unilaterally by the founder without constituting a policy change.
