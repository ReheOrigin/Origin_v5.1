# Commercial Licensing Policy – Origin v5.1 and Global Living Atlas

## 1. Free / Open-Source Tier (AGPLv3)
- All source code is licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
- Academic, non-profit, and individual use is completely free
- All vectors generated automatically enter the public Tier 2 atlas (read/write for everyone)

## 2. Academic Exclusive Partnership – Odyssey Program
**(Completely dormant – no Exclusive seats exist as of November 2025)**

No institution currently holds any Exclusive privileges beyond normal paid Tier 1 access.

The full Odyssey Program described below will activate irrevocably on the exact date and time Robert-James Rehe publicly declares “Odyssey Program is now active” (via signed GitHub commit, email from rrehe.Origin@gmail.com, or on-chain transaction).

Until that declaration, the program remains 100 % dormant.

### One-time pre-activation exception (Founder’s Prerogative)
Before official activation, exactly five (5) institutions worldwide may be granted a temporary 6-month Exclusive preview at the sole and absolute discretion of the founder.

These five preview seats:
- Receive full Exclusive privileges immediately upon private agreement
- Expire automatically after 6 months or upon official program activation (whichever comes first)
- Do not count against future Aotearoa or Global Constellation Tier seats
- Are non-transferable and non-renewable

This is the only pre-activation exception that will ever exist.

Institutions interested in one of the five preview seats must send a single-page expression of interest to:  
**odyssey-preview@origin.institute**  
(No other address will be monitored. No templates, no follow-ups, no lobbying.)

Once the program is activated, this preview option disappears forever.

### Privileges for all Odyssey seats (Aotearoa Tier and Global Constellation Tier – upon activation)
- Permanent private Tier 1 vector storage
- Full exemption from AGPLv3 source-disclosure requirements
- Unlimited cost-price runs on all current and future Origin engines
- Seat on the closed Origin X training-data council
- First access to every new model and feature

### 2A. Aotearoa Tier – New Zealand National Seats (upon activation)
- Fixed at exactly 3 seats reserved exclusively for New Zealand-based institutions
- Every 4 years after activation: lowest-performing NZ seat automatically replaced
- These 3 seats can never be awarded to non-NZ institutions

### 2B. Global Constellation Tier (upon activation)
- Fixed at exactly 20 seats open worldwide
- Every 2 years on 1 January after activation: bottom 3 seats automatically demoted
- Pure merit – no country protection

### 2C. Odyssey Performance Metric (activates only with the program)
Novel pathways successfully submitted to Tier 3  
× OriginX citations crediting the institution’s Tier 1 data  
× Real-world translational impact score

(The exact formula weights and data sources will be published and locked at activation.)

Demoted institutions retain permanent read access to their historical Tier 1 vectors; new runs write only to Tier 2.

There is no application process, no lobbying, and no discretionary overrides after activation.  
The leaderboard and all seat changes are executed by audited smart-contract code.

Total active Exclusive institutions (once activated): maximum 23 (3 Aotearoa + 20 Global Constellation).

This policy is final and will never be altered.  
Operational details (email addresses, on-chain addresses, minor clarifications) may be updated unilaterally by the founder without constituting a policy change.
