# Commercial Licensing Policy – Origin v5.1 and Global Living Atlas

## 1. Free / Open-Source Tier (AGPLv3)
- All source code is licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0  
- Academic, non-profit, and individual use is completely free  
- All vectors generated automatically enter the public Tier 2 atlas (read/write for everyone)

## 2. Academic Exclusive Partnership (invitation only – permanent cap of 10 Active seats)

- A strict maximum of 10 laboratories worldwide may hold an Active Exclusive seat at any one time.
- Seats are granted at the sole discretion of the author and are non-transferable.
- Exclusive benefits include permanent private Tier 1 vector storage, exemption from AGPL source-disclosure, and priority access to OriginX and OriginB.

### 2A. Seat Allocation Philosophy (publicly stated)
- One seat is permanently reserved for a New Zealand-based laboratory in recognition of the project’s origin.
- At least four seats are prioritised for laboratories making the most significant contributions to safe, consensual human regenerative medicine and biological enhancement (scarless healing, extreme longevity, cognitive optimisation, etc.).
- The remaining seats are awarded to laboratories that have demonstrated extraordinary, field-defining impact in synthetic biology, computational biology, genomics, or closely related disciplines that meaningfully advance the Global Living Atlas mission.
- Beginning in 2031 and every five years thereafter, the author may — entirely at his discretion — replace up to two of the least-active seats with new laboratories that have made breakthrough contributions since the previous cycle. The total number of Active seats will never exceed 10.

There is no application process, no lobbying, and no guaranteed expansion. Seats are offered only when the author believes a laboratory’s work dramatically accelerates the broader scientific community’s ability to understand and improve the human condition.

## 3. Commercial / Enterprise Tier
For-profit use (including internal R&D, drug discovery, or service offerings) requires a paid license. Two options:

### 3A. Custom Run Service (fastest on-ramp)
You send private data → author runs Origin v5.1 on secured infrastructure → you receive full results.  
No code transfer, no AGPL obligations.  
Pricing: per-run or subscription.

### 3B. Full Enterprise License
- Internal deployment of the software  
- Right to modify and keep all changes proprietary  
- Private Tier 1 vector storage  
- Dedicated support, SLA, warranties, and indemnification  
- Early access to OriginX and OriginB  

Pricing and terms available on request.
